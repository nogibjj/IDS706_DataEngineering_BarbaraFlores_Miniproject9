## üìÇ  Cloud-Hosted Notebook Data Manipulation

This repository contains a cloud-hosted Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates data manipulation tasks on a sample dataset as part of the requirements for Week 9 of the course.

## Requirements

To complete this assignment, the following tasks were carried out:

1. Set up a cloud-hosted Jupyter Notebook (Google Colab).
2. Performed data manipulation tasks on a sample dataset.


## üêß Dataset
![Ping√ºinos](https://www.hogarmania.com/archivos/202104/aspectos-curiosos-pinguinos-portada-1280x720x80xX.jpg)

In this project, we will perform data analysis using the "Penguins" dataset. The "Penguins" dataset is a collection of data about penguins, gathered by marine ecologist Dr. Kristen Gorman and her team on Torgersen Island near the Palmer Station of the United States Antarctic Program. This research was conducted as part of a long-term study on seabird populations in the Antarctic Peninsula region.

This dataset contains valuable information about different penguin species, including details about their size, weight, and geographical regions. Through data engineering techniques and data analysis, we will explore and extract meaningful insights from this dataset to gain a deeper understanding of these fascinating seabirds
