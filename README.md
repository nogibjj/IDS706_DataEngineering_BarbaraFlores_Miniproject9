## ðŸ“‚  Cloud-Hosted Notebook Data Manipulation


## Requirements

- Set up a cloud-hosted Jupyter Notebook (e.g., Google Colab).
- Perform data manipulation tasks on a sample dataset.

## Grading Criteria

### Setup and Configuration (20 points)
- Ensures the cloud-hosted Jupyter Notebook is correctly configured and accessible.
- Provides clear instructions for accessing the notebook.

### Data Manipulation Tasks (20 points)
- Performs data manipulation tasks on the sample dataset.
- Demonstrates skills in data manipulation using Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy.

## Deliverables

- Link to the cloud-hosted notebook, e.g., Google Colab.
- A document or video demonstrating the tasks performed.

## Instructions

### Setup and Access to the Notebook

1. They have hosted the Jupyter Notebook in the cloud for this task, and you can access it by following this link: [Link to Jupyter Notebook on Google Colab](insert_your_link_here).

2. Ensure you are logged in with your Google account to be able to edit and run the notebook.

### Data Manipulation Tasks

In the cloud-hosted Jupyter Notebook, you will find a sample dataset. Be sure to follow the instructions and carry out the data manipulation tasks as required in the assignment. Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy can be used to perform these tasks.

## Demonstration of Tasks Performed

In addition to the Jupyter Notebook itself, they request a document or a video that demonstrates the tasks performed in the notebook. Screen recording tools can be used to capture actions and explanations while working in the notebook. This will help evaluators understand how the tasks were carried out and what results were obtained.
